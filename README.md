# Prework study guide webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
I built this webpage because I needed a place to record notes from the bootcamp I was attending. The webpage allows me to easily record notes and then access them at a later date. By building this webpage, I had to commit files to Git Multiple times using GitBash, which helped me learn how to create repositories and commit files using Git, instead of using GitHub directly.

## Installation
There are no steps required to install this webpage

## Usage
To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
